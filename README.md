# Card-Compare
(I still need to finish writing this readme)
### Introduction
This project simulates a simple card comparison game that you've likely encountered at some point. In this game, two players (player and house) draw cards from a standard 52 card deck. If the cards match, the house wins; otherwise, the player wins. Through various statistical approaches, this algorithm computes and then visualizes parameters that are scaled over a very large number of simulations. This monte carlo analysis models how experimental values converge to theoretical values, how error dissipates as we gradually become more confident in emerging trends in data, and how to maximize the long-term suffering of your opponent. 

Okay, maybe not that last one.
